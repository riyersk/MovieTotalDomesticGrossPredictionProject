# Movie Total Domestic Gross Prediction Project
This project contains the code for my Metis project Luthor.  In this project, I built a model to predict a movie's total domestic gross from data available on the site boxofficemojo.com.  The files included in this repository are the following:

boxmojo.py : This file contains the spider class I used to scrape the data from boxofficemojo.com.

model.ipynb : This file contains the code I used to clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build my model, and validate my model.
